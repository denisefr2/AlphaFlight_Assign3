				<h2>Aims</h2>
<p>The aim for this assignment is to develop a browser based game free of cost with an intricate story line. To achieve this there are a number of goals required as listed below:</p>
				<h3>Phase One: Research and Training</h3>
<p>Undertake introduction level courses to HTML/5, CSS/3 and JavaScript. Udemy provides a free short course of 5 hours that covers all three topics aimed at preparing students for programming games (Udemy 2022). Pending the outcomes of the course investigate higher learning levels of training in the three code languages. However, this might incur delays in the time frame of the project and might include a cost to each team member.</p>
<p>As Unreal Engine is the game development software Alpha Flight will be utilising it is important the team is familiar with its capabilities. As such, in this phase teams members should enrol and conduct the Balancing Blueprint and C++ in Game Development and the Becoming and Environment Artist in Unreal courses. Both courses are aimed at beginners and would take approximately 4 hours to complete. By the end of the course Alpha Flight team members should have gained exposure to Unreal Engine and feel confident navigating the development platform (Unreal Engine, 2022).</p>
				<h3>Phase Two: Development</h3>
<p>Develop a story line for the game. This will be a two-stage task with an emphasis on completing stage one. The first stage will consist of developing the storyline for the first town city as so the game developers can also focus on build the first city. Stage one is completed once the story line for the first city is complete and the game developers have finished building the first city (including all missions as per storyline).</p>
<p>Once stage one is completed testing will be conducted to identify and issues or errors in the code. The testing should be conducted by additional members of the community as well to capture any new ideas.</p>
				<p>Stage two can then begin on the second city in the same manner of stage one and testing.</p>
