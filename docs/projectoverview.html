				<h1>Project Overview</h1>
					</header>
				<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The goal of this project would be to create a game open to anyone to play, with no cost required during the life of the story. Progression won’t be blocked by a required purchase.</p>
<p>The game will be story focused; with all activities the player takes part in contributing to world building. Each non-player character will play a part in immersing the player in the scenario game world. There will be multiple branches to the story, where each decision the player takes, every quest giver missed, changes both the journey and the conclusion. Replayability is key in the longevity of any role-playing game and it is the prime consideration of this game’s design (Bycer, 2018, Replayability in Game Design, Super jump magazine).</p>
<p>With this goal in mind, it will be necessary to fund both the development, continued maintenance and update cycle using means other than cash shop (Slant, undated, What are the best ways to fund development of an independent game?)(DellaFave, 2014, How to fund your indie game, Game Development).</p>
				
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Browser based games aren’t unusual, however, they are often created with the aim of ‘time gating’ or selling access to content and items, either immediately or after a short time of play. The predatory leanings of developers can often lead to issues with users spending more money than they are able to, or being blocked from content when unwilling to spend money (Wirtz, 2021, Pay to Win Games are Taking Over: How Much Are You Willing to Pay?, Game Designing)(EnyGames, 2021, Pay to Win MMORPG )(Kelly, 2017, Kids who wasted thousands of dollars on gaming, Grunge).</p>
<p>The project is a browser based, single player, role playing game. The game will be story focused, include both text, audio and puzzle interactions. There will be branching story lines dependent on user choice enhancing re-play ability. (Freed, 2014, Branching Conversation Systems and the Working Writer, Blog)</p>
<p>Recently, the most prominent IT trend for gaming has been NFT based games. This system is designed to reward early adopters, it focuses more on monetization than gameplay and storyline. NFT based games are also susceptible to scams and pump-and-dump schemes which provides a toxic environment for gamers, which we will avoid at all costs.</p>
<p>If our team worked on this project, we would have demonstrated our ability to collaborate on bigger projects as a team and technical skills to be able to develop games using major engines such as Unreal Engine 4 and Unity.</p>
				
				<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>Runscape Classic – A fantasy MMORPG browser game built with the Java programming language. This game features an extensive leveling system, quests and combat systems.</p>
<p>Pocket Island – An RPG game based on HTML5 and JavaScript. This game revolves around a wish list for a king and you have to fulfill his wishes to complete the game.</p>
<p>BrowserQuest – An open source MMORPG game built using HTML5 and JavaScript. This game is based on an adventure genre and your task is to explore the world while encounter enemies and making friends along the way.</p>
<p>Crosscode – An open-source action packed role player game (RPG) game based entirely on HTML5. This game has a sci-fi storyline, engaging puzzles and a fast-paced combat system with smooth gaming physics.</p>
<p>What points of difference are there about your project compared to what exist now?</p> 
<p>- Our game will be more story focused. 
- All activities the player takes part in contributes to world building. 
- Each non player character will play a part in immersing the player in the scenario game world. 
- There will be multiple branches to the story, where each decision the player takes, every quest giver missed, changes both the journey and the conclusion. 
- Replayability is key in the longevity of any role playing game and it is the prime consideration of this game’s design (Bycer, 2018, Replayability in Game Design, Super jump magazine).</p>
