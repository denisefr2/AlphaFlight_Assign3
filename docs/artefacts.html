	<h2><b>Denise Freiburger: Story Outline</b></h2>
<p>Aran [Ah rahn] is a world of contrasts. From the warm marshy swamplands of Ecarnas [Ek cahr nars], to the high cold peaks of the Hilmeran [Hel mar ahn] alps and the temperate seaside flats of Aurybar [Au reeh bar].  Each continent is host to races grown accustomed to the unique challenges presented by the environment, be they natural or unnatural.</p>\
<p>Aran is a peaceful land with slowly increasing rumblings of discontent.  The orcs eye the lush farmlands of Aurybar with envy.  Their recently made allies, the Goblins, hold a long standing grudge against the human interlopers and are happy to join forces with the stronger Orcs.  The dragons have recently woken from their long hibernation to find their mountain home claimed by the elves.  The look to reclaim what was lost.  On the plains of Aurybar, the humans ever seek to increase their landholdings, often at the cost of their neighbours goodwill.  The goblins they can manage, but its less certain they will survive the wrath of the sirens.</p>
<p>Which conflict the player becomes involved in will depend on their starting city.  How they are treated by both their own countrymen and the other races, is decided by their race, their class and their starting city.  Elves view dragonkin with hostility because of their blood link to the newly woken dragons.  Human will treat halfers with suspicion following the treaty the halflings have made with the goblins along with their shared racial heritage. All of these and more will give unique choices and dialogue along the journey.</p>
<p>The player will at first be exposed at a micro level, the effects of the increasing unrest on the local village. This view will then broaden as the player continues their journey, meeting new people, interacting with other races and hearing their stories.</p>
<p>Its intended that the player will come to sympathise with the situations faced by all races, making the decisions faced in the later game, more and more difficult.  There will not necessarily be a ‘right’ decision.</p>
<p>Ultimately the decisions made by the player will decide the fate of Aran for good or for ill.</p>
<p>Below is a sample of the start of a mid-campaign mission, including examples of non player characters reacting to the player race.  The full quest is not shown for brevity.</p>
