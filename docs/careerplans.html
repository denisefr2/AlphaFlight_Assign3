					<h2>What I need to do?</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="item19">
					<p>If I wish to continue to pursue the role of front end developer, I should continue working on an IT degree.</p>
					<p>Ideally I should be focussing on learning the requisite programming languages, (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React Native, JQuery).</p>
					<p>While studying, I should take the opportunity to familiarise myself with graphic design applications with an eye to learning wireframing and element designing (e.g., Adobe Illustrator).</p>
					<p>It is critical I become familiar with the tools most commonly used by front end developers in Australia.</p>
					<p>Overall, apart from the formal qualification, experience is key.  Learning by doing and building experience by creating a portfolio of work and ideas.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item20">
					<p>To continue my career path to achieve my goal career as an SDM there are several things I can do. </p>
					<p>Firstly, focus on completing the ITIL Managing Professional Mater’s Program. </p>
					<p>Secondly, work to getting qualifications in areas such as cloud services to become competitive when applying for jobs. </p>
					<p>Finally, ensure that I continue to gain experience within my current job role and take any opportunities to work beyond my current role. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="item21">
					<p>Complete the Bachelor of Information Technology</p>
					<p>Study other E-courses on the side such as the Linux training program</p>
					<p>Study Master of Cyber Security</p>
					<p>Find a job in the relevant field and build work experience.</p>
					<p>Once confident in my abilities, experience and portfolio, I will then apply for this job.</p>

					<p class="center">Graduate Front End Developer</p>
					<p class="center">↓</p>
					<p class="center">Software Engineer Front-End</p>
					<p class="center">↓</p>

					<p>My career path should see me continue as a Level 3 Systems Administrator for at least 5 years gaining technical knowledge and skills. </p>
					<p>At the same time, I will continue the mentorship program I am taking with my current SDM whilst gaining the required ITIL certificates. </p>
					<p>Once I gain the ITIL certificates and have enough on the job experience I will be ready to start applying for an SDM role. </p>

					<h2>Common Elements</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="item25">
					<p>The front-end developer and service delivery manager both require technical skills and knowledge of cloud services/applications. These skills differentiate between the roles by being technically focused as for a developer or the strategic management of a team of developers as for an SDM. Both roles require customer skills such as, interpreting the client’s needs, conveying an achievable plan and successfully delivery a product.</p>
					<p>As an SDM there is a requirement to in some situations integrate with a cyber defence operations lead. As both roles are based around providing adequate solutions to the customer they can work closely together to ensure this. The cyber lead will provide advice and suggestions for implementing best practices into a system. The SDM can in turn tasks members of their team to implement suggestions made by the cyber lead. </p>
					<p>One element is prevalent across all three jobs as a critical requirement and that is the ability to work in team. Furthermore, all positions highlight a requirement for someone who is able to integrate soundly into a team environment either as a member or supervisor/manager.</p>
