Testing from early development is critical to ensure the released game provides an optimal user experience. The intent is to include a beta release to allow users the opportunity both test the game and gain early access.  <br><br>

As suggested previously at the completion of stage one (building the first city narrative and game) a useability test will be taken by members of Alpha Flight and the Alpha Flight community (friends, family, and followers).  <br><br>

The optimal testing cycle for successful release includes documented test cases, formalised defect reporting and finally regression testing.  If it is intended to release the game in multiple languages, localisation testing with need to be included prior to international version release (Swathisri 2020, QA Touch). <br><br>

Test cases will be various and strictly documented to allow the limited testing team to fully test as many scenarios as is possible (ReQuest, 201, Learn how to write test cases effectively).  Defect reporting will be via a prewritten form including all necessary data to allow code correction.  Again, using strict documentation guidelines is critical to ensure both clarity in testing and bug fixing (STF, 2020, Defect Report).  This stage of testing will be white box or case base testing (Hamilton, 2021, Guru99). <br><br>

Once the initial phase has completed, regression testing will be carried out to ensure both the identified bugs are fixed and the existing code has not been adversely affected by the changes. <br><br>

The beta version of the game will include a user acceptance test (UAT) for the community to fill out, if they wish, to capture specific information. This information will include web browser and version, operating systems, audio devices, computer hardware to capture and incompatibility issues. In addition, the UAT will also focus on points of user experience to capture any areas for improvement. Any issues identified in the UAT will be remediated by the team to ensure the delivery of a sound game. <br><br>

UAT is a form of black box testing as the users will have no information about the ‘back end’ code but will best testing purely for useability at a very high level (Hamilton, 2021, Guru99) <br><br>

This process as allude to previously will be conducted again in stage two (building the second city narrative and game). Once beta testing of the two stages is complete and any issues have been remediated the game will then be ready for release.</p> </div>
