			<p><u><b>What went well?</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Everything seemed to work well from my perspective. Even with a reduced member count, we completed the project well within timeframe.</p>
			<p>Work was mostly self nominated, anything outside of that, we decided as a group. All members were open to discussion on improvements to their work, leaving ego out of things.</p>
			<p>Communication during the bulk of the work was constant (via Teams chat) and informative. Anyone who needed help was given it promptly and cheerfully.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>In my view, this whole assignment went very well, all team members played a crucial role and contributed an equal amount of effort.</p>
			<p>	Our team was able to meet key milestone dates with ease, communicate effectively and action all listed agendas after every meeting.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>From the start we had a group of members who were enthusiastic and eager to get started, this resulted in the formation of our group earlier than excepted. This enabled our group to form bonds and become familiar with each other faster before really starting to get into the bulk of the assignment.</p>
			<p>The drive of my Alpha Flight team mates never died down and everyone put in equal amounts to the assignment and the improvement of it. This allowed for the assignment to be completed to a standard we can all be proud of.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the team communicated effectively both inside meetings and through the chat function of Microsoft Teams. Everyone continually monitored the team chat throughout the entirety of the process. Clear communication meant everyone was prompt in informing others of their intended work, the outputs achieved or if they had time to help others. This meant that the assignment always had direction, and a continual push of effort from the team.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>What could be improved?</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>The only minor issue I can think of is that we were perhaps too keen to be obliging! If that can be called a criticism?</p>
			<p>Now we are more familiar with each, I think that this issue may not surface for the next assignment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>There was one team member we lost where we had enough time to replace, if we knew earlier that that member was going to withdraw from the course.</p>
			<p>This type of situation could be mitigated in the future if we set rules on what our team would do if a team member were unresponsive after a certain number of days.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>We lost three members of our group from when we started.</p> 
			<p>In the future I would have clear outlines on how long the team will wait for someone who misses key milestones. This prevents the stalling of work due to an individual's absence.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>At least one thing that was surprising</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>I came into this project deeply sceptical of the benefits of group work, particularly in study. I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how well our group worked together.</p>
			<p>Everyone is keen to ‘muck in’ and get the work done to the best of our collective ability. I feel very lucky to have found my fellow Alpha Flight members.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>I have heard a lot of bad group experiences prior of starting this assignment so the one thing that surprised me the most was how well I enjoyed working with my group.</p>
			<p>Everyone was respectful to each other, and each had a great sense of humour. Unquestionably, Alpha Flight members have top class personalities, and it was a pleasure working with them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>I was genuinely surprised by how well our team worked together. There was no member who did not put in an equal amount of effort, no member who took over everything, nobody too quiet, and nobody too loud.</p>
			<p>Our personality assessments did outline that we had similar personalities and that really worked to our advantage. I have really enjoyed working with my team and they have made the dreaded group assignment a breeze.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Flexibility is key when working in groups. To be an effective member you must be ready to either do work as required and assist others when needed.</p>
			<p>Look for work to do, ask if you’re needed, just proof read if there’s nothing else to do.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>This group experience taught me that excellent teamwork creates great synergy.</p>
			<p>The fact that everyone was working relentlessly to achieve our common goal is truly inspiring.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Everyone in our group wanted to help and improve the work of others. When you are open to learning from others and that experience is positive there is a big benefit from working in a group.</p>
			<p>My teammates taught me a lot over the period of this assignment and that is one of the positives I learnt about working in a group environment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="joint-comment">
			<h1>Joint comments</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="joint-comments">
			<p><b><u>What went well?</b></u></p>
			<p>Overall we feel the experience was valuable. We worked well together weathering the loss of two team members and ultimately completing the project on time and to our joint satisfaction.</p>
			<p>We all felt valued and that our contributions were important to the ultimate outcome of the assignment. There has been no discontent expressed, no sign of anything less than cheerful commitment to doing the best we can as a group.</p>
			<p>Our disparate backgrounds and experience, rather than harm us, have seemed to create the perfect mix of skills and personalities.</p>
			<p>Our success may be in some part be due our willingness to communicate via Team chat at all times. When only one of us was online working we would leave chat messages for the other to pick up and either action or simply acknowledge.</p>
			<p>We picked up tasks when needed and 'got on with things' leading to what we feel has been a very pleasant and successful experience.</p>
			<p><b><u>What could be improved?</b></u></p>
			<p>The major issue for us was losing team mates early without any clear guidelines on whether we should continue to wait for others to join or continue.</p>
			<p>We think at least one may have withdrawn from the course, but were slow to receive any indication of what should be done.</p>
			<p>Perhaps clear guidelines or milestones that prompt the group when to move forward as is, or continue to wait for more members would have assisted us in this.</p>
			<p>This put what could have been an early pall on the group dynamics, which thankfully we were able to move past.</p>
			<p><b><u>At least one thing that was surprising</b></u></p>
			<p>Unanimously, we were all surprised by how well we worked as a team. Our profiles do show that we have similar personalities, so perhaps the lack of an 'extravert' type to take over meant we didn't feel pushed or 'bossed'.</p>
			<p>We all seem to have had negative experiences in group work prior to this, and came in expecting the worst. It was a nice surprise for all of us for this to prove such a wonderful and productive experience.</p>
			<p><b><u>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b></u></p>
			<p>Co-operation seems to be key. We worked as a team at all times, checking each other's work, asking for help when needed, and supplying help where we could.</p>
			<p>The answer for us seems to be that operating successfully in a group means behaving like a group. Not three individuals looking to shine, but instead, finding ways for the group to shine.</p>
