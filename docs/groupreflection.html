			<p>I believe this whole assignment went well, once momentum was built, everything just started to fall into place. All team members were consistent with their contributions, and everyone played a crucial role and contributed an equal amount of effort.</p>
			<p>In similar way with assignment 2, our team was able to meet key milestone dates with ease, communicate effectively and action all listed agendas after every meeting.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Alpha Flight learnt a lot through the development of assignment two. As such, I found the team was in a good place moving into assignment three. Our team’s operating procedures (meeting times, documentation method and constant communication) allowed for the development of assignment three to be smooth and concise.</p>
			<p>Creating the timeline and tasks early on meant that each member had focus and could work on tasks at their own pace and unguided. In the end, the team met every deadline and worked well together.</p>

		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>The issue I can see is that everyone spent so much time and effort in this assignment, yet we only scratched the surface of this project.</p>
			<p>If we had an even better time management, we may be able to squeeze more work in this initial phase of the project and at the same time mitigating the risk of work overload.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>I believe the project we chose was more extensive than we had expected. Without anyone in the group having prior knowledge of game development, the task itself was too complex for us to learn and complete in the time allowed.</p>

		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Apart from being surprised once again by how well I got along with my team, I found it very surprising that I enjoyed working on this assignment.</p>
			<p>Everyone was so co-operative and intuitive that it felt like designing and building a game rather than doing an assignment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Initially, I was overwhelmed by the idea of the project in this assignment. However, when I started looking at the content required, I learned it was also about planning and project managing. In the end I found that quite enjoyable to do and learnt from the practice.</p>

		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b></u></p>

		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Text</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>I have learned many things during the period of this course in regard to my group, but the most significant lesson is that when everyone puts down their ego and think of the objective as a team, it creates great synergy and excellent teamwork.</p>
			<P>If we were to do this again I would have tried to better understand the nature of each project to select one that was more achievable.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>When you get a group as committed and hardworking as the members of Alpha Flight, a difficult task becomes easy. We learnt a lot from each other and always looked to help each other out.</p>
			<p>The past two months have proven that a group assignment doesn’t have to be a negative experience but can be a good one.</p>
