			<p>I believe this whole assignment went well, once momentum was built, everything just started to fall into place. All team members were consistent with their contributions, and everyone played a crucial role and contributed an equal amount of effort.</p>
			<p>In similar way with assignment 2, our team was able to meet key milestone dates with ease, communicate effectively and action all listed agendas after every meeting.</p>

			<p>The issue I can see is that everyone spent so much time and effort in this assignment, yet we only scratched the surface of this project.</p>
			<p>If we had an even better time management, we may be able to squeeze more work in this initial phase of the project and at the same time mitigating the risk of work overload.</p>

			<p>Apart from being surprised once again by how well I got along with my team, I found it very surprising that I enjoyed working on this assignment.</p>
			<p>Everyone was so co-operative and intuitive that it felt like designing and building a game rather than doing an assignment.</p>

			<p>I have learned many things during the period of this course in regard to my group, but the most significant lesson is that when everyone puts down their ego and think of the objective as a team, it creates great synergy and excellent teamwork.</p>
