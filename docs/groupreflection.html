			<p><u><b>What went well?</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>As with Assignment 2, we worked well as a group with jobs being shared and picked up without push back or issue.  For this assignment, all facets seemed to flow smoothly while still creating a good outcome for the team.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>I believe this whole assignment went well, once momentum was built, everything just started to fall into place. All team members were consistent with their contributions, and everyone played a crucial role and contributed an equal amount of effort.</p>
			<p>In similar way with assignment 2, our team was able to meet key milestone dates with ease, communicate effectively and action all listed agendas after every meeting.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Alpha Flight learnt a lot through the development of assignment two. As such, I found the team was in a good place moving into assignment three. Our team’s operating procedures (meeting times, documentation method and constant communication) allowed for the development of assignment three to be smooth and concise.</p>
			<p>Creating the timeline and tasks early on meant that each member had focus and could work on tasks at their own pace and unguided. In the end, the team met every deadline and worked well together.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>What could be improved?</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Our project was too large in scope for the boundaries of this assignment.  This nessitated we guess rather produce concrete results.  In future it might be worth bearing this lesson in mind and chosing smaller projects that might be able to have concrete results in the time allowed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>The issue I can see is that everyone spent so much time and effort in this assignment, yet we only scratched the surface of this project.</p>
			<p>If we had an even better time management, we may be able to squeeze more work in this initial phase of the project and at the same time mitigating the risk of work overload.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>I believe the project we chose was more extensive than we had expected. Without anyone in the group having prior knowledge of game development, the task itself was too complex for us to learn and complete in the time allowed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>At least one thing that was surprising</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>How easily the group produced so much content in the relatively short amount of time alloted for this work.  Initially, the assignment specification was overwhelming but once work started, it proved less onerous that at first thought.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Apart from being surprised once again by how well I got along with my team, I found it very surprising that I enjoyed working on this assignment.</p>
			<p>Everyone was so co-operative and intuitive that it felt like designing and building a game rather than doing an assignment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Initially, I was overwhelmed by the idea of the project in this assignment. However, when I started looking at the content required, I learned it was also about planning and project managing. In the end I found that quite enjoyable to do and learnt from the practice.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>As a group project skeptic, I’ve learned that groups of disparate people with wide ranging skills may produce excellent results as long as they are prepared to work as a team.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>I have learned many things during the period of this course in regard to my group, but the most significant lesson is that when everyone puts down their ego and think of the objective as a team, it creates great synergy and excellent teamwork.</p>
			<P>If we were to do this again I would have tried to better understand the nature of each project to select one that was more achievable.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>When you get a group as committed and hardworking as the members of Alpha Flight, a difficult task becomes easy. We learnt a lot from each other and always looked to help each other out.</p>
			<p>The past two months have proven that a group assignment doesn’t have to be a negative experience but can be a good one.</p>

		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>What went well?</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Consensus is that processes and workflow from assignment 2 continued to work well with this assignment.  The group agrees that by setting a framework, meeting regularly to discuss issues and allocate tasks, has worked to ensure a smooth flow of progress on this assignment.</p>
			<p>Once again, the mix of personalities, skills and attitude has meant the completion of this assignment with minimal stress.  We Worked together well, happy to meet and discuss how to progress with our joint assignment.  As with the previous assignment, we were happy to put aside our individual needs to work towards the success of the team.<br><br>
			This we feel is key to our successful collaboration.  Our goal wasn’t individual success but group success and that is what we all worked towards.  Any worry or stress was focussed on not letting the team down and our mutual support and encouragement overcame any hiccoughs.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>What could be improved?</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>We feel the project chosen may have been too large to be properly dealt with in the timeframe allowed by this assignment.  The timeframe coupled with the group’s existing skill set meant we were unable to deliver significant actual progress as opposed to theoretical milestones and artifacts.  We would have liked to produce at least on playable level but unfortunately due to the time required to learn on the necessary skills, for example, coding language, use of the chosen engine, 3d rendering, we were unable to do so.</p>
			<p>In the future, we will use this lesson to ensure goals for short projects are more achievable.

		</p>
		</div>
		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>At least one thing that was surprising</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>Generally, we were once more surprised by how well the group worked together.  Tackling what appeared to be a large amount of work to be done in a relatively short period gave us pause initially.  However, once work commenced we soon realised our previous experience working together meant we completed the work efficiently.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div class="questions">
			<p><u><b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b></u></p>
		</div>
		<div class="anwsers">
			<p>We learned that it is possible to successfully complete tasks as a group, when the group members are willing to contribute without allowing their egos to get in the way of cooperation.</p>
			<p>We hope we can use the positive experiences gained during the past two assignments and bring those to future group interactions.  Group work, particularly as part of study, are often fraught with drama and underperforming members carried along by the hard work of others.  However, as we’ve found this time, with a little thought and conscious effort, it is possible for three complete strangers at various ends of a country, to work together to produce a cohesive and completed assignment.
