			<p>As an ex-Defence member, I have travelled and lived in most parts of the country and settled down in Western Australia. In WA, I spend most of my time on some of the most picturesque beaches in the country, either surfing, 4x4 driving or camping. Additionally, I have two pugs that join my partner and I in adventuring and exploring the western coastline of Australia.
	Whilst in Defence, I developed basic IT skills and knowledge which allowed me to create bespoke solutions for a range of applications. This included managing ad-hoc networks and providing basic cyber training, specifically on signature reduction. Throughout my career, my passion for IT really started to grow.
	My transition out of Defence was what we call a “soft landing” as I became a backend administrator for a network I previously used as a customer. After a year in this position, I have seen enormous growth in my skills and knowledge as I become more familiar with enterprise IT solutions. I look forward to continuing my IT journey with my team, Alpha Flight.

			<p>I’m a gamer.  I have been since Wolfenstein 3D in 1992.  Gaming is both my hobby and my relaxation. I’m keenly interested in how games are created, both from technological and story telling perspective.  My first games were first person shooters but once I discovered role playing games (RPGs), I looked for more story in all types of games. Nothing satisfies me more than being immersed in a digital story that gives that ‘wow that’s clever’ feeling. I’ve been interested in technology and how things work for most of my life. That interest was confined to personal hobbies until the past 20 years or so. In that time I’ve been employed in various IT related roles, including first and second level support, technical training and as a technical specialist.  Working with business related front-end technology has only increased my interest and ‘need to know’.</p>

			<p>I was introduced to computers at a young age, my older brother who loved video games taught me how to play games. The first game that I played was Half-Life Counter Strike, then I went on to play MMORPG’s. My favourite game was Runescape when it first came out, it has amazing storylines, fantasy elements and awesome adventures. It’s that game where I learned to write scripts so my character could auto farm but not long after my account was hacked. I believe it was that moment where I gained interest in the cyber security field but never decided to pursue it until now. My hobbies now are partying and by party, I mean reading books, I like to read non-fiction and science related books. Although I have no experience in the IT related work field, I am currently devoting all my time to learning in hopes that one day I can become a cyber security specialist.</p>
