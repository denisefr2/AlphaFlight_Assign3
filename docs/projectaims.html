				<h1>Project Aims</h1>
					</header>

				<h3>Aims</h3>
<p>The aim for this assignment is to develop a browser based game free of cost with an intricate story line. To achieve this there are a number of goals required as listed below:</p>
				<h4>Phase One: Research and Training</h4>
<p>Undertake introduction level courses to HTML/5, CSS/3 and JavaScript. Udemy provides a free short course of 5 hours that covers all three topics aimed at preparing students for programming games (Udemy 2022). Pending the outcomes of the course investigate higher learning levels of training in the three code languages. However, this might incur delays in the time frame of the project and might include a cost to each team member.</p>
<p>As Unreal Engine is the game development software Alpha Flight will be utilising it is important the team is familiar with its capabilities. As such, in this phase teams members should enrol and conduct the Balancing Blueprint and C++ in Game Development and the Becoming and Environment Artist in Unreal courses. Both courses are aimed at beginners and would take approximately 4 hours to complete. By the end of the course Alpha Flight team members should have gained exposure to Unreal Engine and feel confident navigating the development platform (Unreal Engine, 2022).</p>
				<h4>Phase Two: Development</h4>
<p>Develop a story line for the game. This will be a two-stage task with an emphasis on completing stage one. The first stage will consist of developing the storyline for the first town city as so the game developers can also focus on build the first city. Stage one is completed once the story line for the first city is complete and the game developers have finished building the first city (including all missions as per storyline).</p>
<p>Once stage one is completed testing will be conducted to identify and issues or errors in the code. The testing should be conducted by additional members of the community as well to capture any new ideas.</p>
<p>Stage two can then begin on the second city in the same manner of stage one and testing.</p>
				<h4>Phase Three: Building</h4>
<p>Sign up to Firebase as a backend server-side for the game so that players can save their progress and return later for competition. Firebase offers a free package that would suit the requirements for the development phase. In the future when the game goes live depending on user demand this will have to be changed to a paid for via a on demand subscription (Firebase, 2022).</p>
				<h4>Phase Four: Advertisement and Merchandise</h4>
<p>Begin advertising of the game on social media platforms and create accounts for our game on all of them. This can include game play streams on platform Twitch.</p>
<p>As merchandise is the means for funding the game this is an important step for Alpha Flight. Merchandise will include all basics like T-Shirts, Hats, stickers, and the like. However, the team has also discussed creating a unique line of computer accessories including mouse pads, mouse, keyboards, and headsets. These items will be available on the game site and by our social media sites.</p>
				<h4>Phase Five: Future and Assessments</h4>
<p>As a team at the competition of all previous stages conduct a team reflection assessing the overall outcomes of the project. Main points for discussion are to be  
	- Discuss anything that went well and should continue over future projects. 
	- Discuss anything that went wrong over the period of the project. 
	- Discuss any fixes that will aid in future projects.   
After conducting a team assessment consider the next phase of the project. Weather that be developing a new world/city, making an app version for Android/IOS making a new game etc.</p>
