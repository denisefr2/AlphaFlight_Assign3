				<div class="center"><h2>What is ‘Cat-a-wall’?</h2>
				<p>Cat-a-wall is a free to play browser based role playing game.  The development team are driven by a passion for gaming and love of story telling.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="subhead">
				<div class="center"><h2>Why?</h3>
				<p>Like many gamers, the developers are frustrated with the lack of quality in free to play games.  It is our dream to provide gamers with a free to play experience that doesn’t include predatory monetisation, while providing a compelling game play experience with a strong story and replayability.<p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="subhead">
				<div class="center"><h2>Planning</h2>
				<p>It is envisaged that the initial stages of the project will focus on planning.  The issues to be discussed and resolved are discussed below.</p>
				</div>
				<b><p><em>Budget</em></p></b>
				<ul>
				<li>Setting the budget is critical to success.  Any project can run over budget if the scope is not carefully set from the beginning.  Game development, in particular, can be subject to ‘scope creep’ which for a small independent developer can spell disaster.</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Funding</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>Budget and Funding are inextricably linked.  The game budget will be redundant if the means to fund development are not discussed and agreed at this stage.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Audience</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>Discussions and decisions around intended audience must be taken prior to commencement of development.  If there are any restrictions in content that must be set due to ratings restrictions they must be included early in planning to avoid delays once development has commenced in earnest.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Platform</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>Decisions around platform may seem redundant as it is intended to release a browser based game.  However, issues of compatibility must be considered and settled prior to development.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Labour</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>Labour costs, requirements and recruitment strategies will form part of our project plans at the outset.  These are issues again, that are critical to the successful completion of our project.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Timeframes</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>Game development, particularly a story driven role playing game, generally takes anything up to five years from initial meetings to release.  To reach successful delivery of the project, time frames, including some room for road blocks or faster completion, must be set and monitored closely throughout the development cycle.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="subhead">
				<div class="center"><h2>Storyboards</h2>
				<p>The second stage will focus on story outlines, environmental elements and character details.</p>
				</div>
				<b><p><em>Branching story outline</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>As story is a significant component each step will be planned, written and laid out in both written and graphic form.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>NPC dialogue</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Each quest and its composite parts, including all quest and incidental and branching dialogue will be written and approved to ensure a cohesive story.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Scene visions</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Along with setting story and dialogue, each quest and quest chain, will have a visualisation in the form of a scene vision.  The scene vision will show characters and locations in rough outline to give the project team, visual artists and level designers ample information and boundaries to work to.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Map details</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A fully detailed and annotated map will be created as both an assistance to planning and coding.  This map may be available as a facet of merchandising as a pre release purchase.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Hub details</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Along with map details, concept art of all cities and hub will be created to allow coders to create fully realised towns and cities.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Race details</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						3D rendering of all races, in their appropriate class armours will be created by the 3D artists.  These will be available to the level designer and perhaps available bound with other art then made available for purchase in a way similar to the maps.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Class details</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						All class statistics, including base statistics affected by race and starting city, will be set and available to level and game designer.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Craft details</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						All details around the intended three crafting types will be set, including any favourable statistics arising out of race or city choice.  Details of craft class specific quests and dialogue will also be set at this stage.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="subhead">
				<div class="center"><h2>Scoping</h2>
				<p>Scoping will be our third stage.  This will involve setting the limits of what is achievable on a practical level when designing the visual/audio elements of the game.</p>
				</div>
				<b><p><em>Models</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						During the scoping phase, all character models, both npc and player, will be listed and categorized.  Any ancillary models, such as creatures, will also be listed.  Numbers of each type to be created will be set. As with all stages of planning it is imperative we avoid scope creep.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Level design</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						During this phase, the level designer in consultation with the game designer and game developer will map out each level, including all overland areas, towns, villages and cities.  This will ensure there is an accurate estimation of assets needed and time required for creation at the coding stage.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Audio/visual design</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The audio engineer with work with the level designer, game developer and game designer to scope out the overall audio and visual feel of game.  At this point the project is approaching its coding stage so it is critical these points are set and understood by all stakeholders.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Physics</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The physics of the game environment are an important component of how the finished game with feel to the player.  Physics should be discussed in tandem with level design also but as its own separate component.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Mechanics</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Game mechanics, along with physics affect how the game responds during combat, crafting or when the player interacts with the game world at large.  These will be discussed and set during this stage.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>UI design</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Finally, UI design.  How the player triggers spells, events, skills and crafting.  The design should be discussed with the UI/UX designer, the game designer and the graphic artists.  The final design should reflect the ethos of the game to as large a degree as possible.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="subhead">
				<div class="center"><h2>Coding</h2>
				</div>
				<p>At the coding stage, the culmination of all the prior planning will bear fruit.  The level designer, game designer, UI designer, Audio engineer and all other staff will start working on the nuts and bolts of the game.</p>
				<b><p><em>Quest design</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Quest design and dialogue go hand in hand.  The level designer will bear these in mind while assigning assets to maps.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Models in engine</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						All models created will be imported into the engine and rigged to ensure they blend with the environment and function as expected.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Maps</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Map will be imported and integrated into gameplay.  The UI designer will incorporate these into the UI wherever necessary.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>UI elements</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The UI will be created using art and other elements created by the team.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Testing</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Testing will start as soon as there is playable code per the testing schedule.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="subhead">
				<div class="center"><h2>Marketing</h2>
				<p>Marketing is set at this point but may in fact commence earlier and carry on during all stages of the project.  Expected avenues to be explored are listed below.</p>

				</ul>				
			</div>
			<div class="subhead">
				<div class="center"><h2>Release</h2>
				<p>The final stage is release.  Once Part 1 of the game is tested and retested, it will be ready for release.</p>
				</div>
				<b><p><em>Final testing</em></p></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Any final testing will be carried out well before release date.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b><p><em>Error fixing</em></p></b>
