<h1>Level Designer</h1>  

<h3>Level designers work in a manner as their name suggests whereby they develop segments or levels of a game. The creative process of a level designer typically starts with the creation of real-life sketches or models to begin to visualise the level. Eventually, this forms the basis of all the documentation and development of the game's environment. The final stage is to build the level itself in the most in-depth and life-like way possible (Techopedia, 2017). A level designers contribution here can include developing the "entry and exit points of each level and guide[ing] the player logically through the game via its rules, rewards and objectives" (CG Spectrum, 2022).</h3> 
<h3>For a level designer to be considered for a position with Alpha Flight, they will need the following skills or qualifications:</h3> 
<h3>Prior experience as a level designer using Unreal Engine (applicant must be able to provide proof):</h3> 
<h3>- Proficiency in C++, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</h3> 
<h3>- Experience using Unreal Engine</h3>  
<h3>- High level of self-motivation and good communication and people skills (IntoGames, 2020).</h3>   
<h3>- Understand the process of building a game design</h3>  
<H3>A level designer will be an essential member of the team as they help bring the game to life. Alpha Flight aims to pair the level designer closely with the game developer to ensure the seamless delivery of Cat-A-Wall. The two team members are required to share in the vision of the game to ensure that what we foresee the game to be is what is delivered.</h3>
