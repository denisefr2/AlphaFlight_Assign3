<p>Overall, we feel the experiences gained from assignment two were valuable. 

We worked well together weathering the loss of two team members and ultimately completing the project on time and to our joint satisfaction. We all felt valued and that our contributions were important to the ultimate outcome of the assignment. There has been no discontent expressed and no sign of anything less than a cheerful commitment to doing the best we can as a group. 

Our disparate backgrounds and experience, rather than harm us, have created the perfect mixture of skills and personalities. Our success may be in some part be due our willingness to always communicate via Team chat. When only one of us was online working we would leave chat messages for the other to pick up and either action or simply acknowledge. We picked up tasks when needed and 'got on with things' leading to what we felt has been a very pleasant and successful experience.  

The major issue for us was losing team mates early without any clear guidelines on whether we should wait for other members to join or continue without them. We believe at least one may have withdrawn from the course but were slow to receive any indication of what should be done. Perhaps clear guidelines or milestones that prompt the group when to move forward as is or continue to wait for more members would have assisted us in this. This put what could have been an early pall on the group dynamics, which thankfully we were able to move past. 

Moving forward into the next assignment the three of us have confirmed that if we were to withdraw from course or be unable to contribute over a specific period that we would communicate that to the team promptly. This will ensure that the team does not lose momentum waiting.  

For this current assignment Alpha Flight has agreed to work in a similar fashion to assignment two. As a collectively the decision was made to continue Wednesday and Sunday meetings, high levels of communication on the chat function on teams and a to continue using our system for creating and adding into our working document. As we have now worked on an assignment together as a group already we are very comfortable with each otherâ€™s strengths and weakness and have found that it works to our advantage in this assignment. We have also agreed to continue to encourage, tech and learn from each other to ensure we get the most out of working as a group.</p>
