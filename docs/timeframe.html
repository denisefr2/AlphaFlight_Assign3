			<p>- Video Game Writer: Created a story in the way of a blurb to describe the approximate journey a player will take. Development of mission stories etc. will occur at a later stage however, if achievable one mission will be created as a design concept. This task is complete once the above has been written into the assignment document.</p>
			<p>- Project Development: allocate members of Alpha Flight to specific roles concerning the first 15 weeks of the project. These roles are to be allocated into the teamâ€™s timeline with specified roles and due outs over that period. This project will be considered complete once it has been transcribed into the assignment document.</p>
			<p>- Provide an additional blurb on an Audio Engineer for recruitment purposes. Using the team's existing website as a point of reference begin to build and develop Alpha Flights website for assignment three. The first task will be completed once it is reflected in the assignment document. The second task is ongoing, however, a roughly developed site and sub-sites should be created at a minimum.</p>
