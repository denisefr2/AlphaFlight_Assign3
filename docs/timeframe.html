			<p>- Provide an additional blurb on an Audio Engineer for recruitment purposes. Using the team's existing website as a point of reference begin to build and develop Alpha Flights website for assignment three. The first task will be completed once it is reflected in the assignment document. The second task is ongoing, however, a roughly developed site and sub-sites should be created at a minimum.</p>
